# course-material

This directory contains course material for  CVEN 5999: Special Topics - Data Analytics for Development. 

The directory is structured by weeks (wk-01, wk-02, etc.). Each weekly directory contains templates for:

- live coding exercises (live-XX)
- programming exercises (program-XX)
- homework exercises (hw-XX)
- learning reflections (learning-XX)

The XX is replaced by the lecture week. Where several exercises exist for one category, then the files receive one additional letter starting with 'a', then 'b', etc.
